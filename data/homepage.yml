    My expertise lies in data management and analytics, but I’ve also dabbled in data engineering and cloud computing technologies to 
    broaden my knowledge of the entire data lifecycle. I'm results-driven, super curious, and committed to continuous learning.

    I love blending different data streams to help uncover new patterns and insights.
