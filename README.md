# Data Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is dedicated to crafting a compelling showcase of my data career journey using the R package portfoliodown. The website is constructed on the Raditian-Hugo theme, a customized version inspired by the template provided by Matt Dancho and Radity. The portfolio not only serves as a visual representation of my skills but also provides insights into my experiences and accomplishments in the realm of data projects.
